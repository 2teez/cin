# cin

## Name
cin - works like cin in c++ std::cin to get "any" value from the cli.

### Installation

#### Use rust cargo

  ```
   cargo run cin
  ```

  #### Using from Github link:
 In the Cargo.toml file
 ```
  cin = {git = "https://github.com/2teez/cin"}
 ```

 use in your rust file like so
 ```
  use cin::cin::cin;
 ```

 ### Description
 cin makes it easier to receive input from the keyboard when building CLI programs in Rust.

 Reading values from standard input in Rust can feel verbose and unintuitive, especially for beginners. Unlike in C++ or Python, where taking input is simple and introduced early (e.g., std::cin in C++ or input() in Python), Rust requires more boilerplate and familiarity with traits like FromStr and manual read_line parsing.

 This crate aims to simplify that process by providing a familiar, beginner-friendly function: cin::<T>(), inspired by C++'s [std::cin](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cin.html). With cin, you can read values of any supported type with a single lineâ€”making input handling in Rust as smooth as in other languages.
